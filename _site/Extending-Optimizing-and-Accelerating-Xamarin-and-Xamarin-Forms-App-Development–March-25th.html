    <p>When it comes to Xamarin, we know many of you are interested but you also have lots of questions.<br />
For this reason, this month we set out to try and get answers to some of those questions. When people registered we asked them what they wanted to know.<br />
James Montemagno will be speaking and after analysing all your requests he’s come up with the following plan for what to talk about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leveraging C# and it’s awesome features to developer iOS and Android apps with Xamarin allows for rapid application development, but how can you go even further. In this session we will take a look at tools, libraries, and other resources to increase productivity enabling you to write less code and share more code across all of your apps. We will additionally dive through everything new in Xamarin.Forms and several tools that Forms has built in to help with cross platform development. No matter how you are developing applications with Xamarin you will be sure to find something new and fun to use on a day to day basis.</p>
</blockquote>
