    <p>I know the group’s been very quiet for a while. And, even though life’s been getting in the way, I’ve not forgotten about it.<br />
There’s a possibility of something later in the year (more details when I have them) but for now, I have a question for you.<br />
It doesn’t matter if you came to one meeting or dozens.<br />
You may have been to the recent meetings or not been for years.<br />
Whatever your situation, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p><strong>How, why, and was attending past meetings a good thing for you?</strong></p>

<p>I have my own thoughts based on “running” the group for 7+ years and had lots of positive and a few negative experiences along the way. (Maybe I’ll share them if you’re interested.) But, good or bad, I want to hear from you.</p>

<p>Here are a few deeper questions if you have the time to give a longer answer but any response will be appreciated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did you come just out of curiosity and to gain wider knowledge?</li>
  <li>Was it a way to learn or hear about something specific?</li>
  <li>Did you come with specific goals from attending? and were those goals met or achieved?</li>
  <li>Was it just an opportunity to pass the time with some free beer and pizza?</li>
  <li>Did the promise of freebies (SWAG) impact your choice to attend?</li>
  <li>How would your apps (and even your life) be different if you’d not come or the meetings had never happened?</li>
  <li>Is what you learned at past meetings still relevant or have you moved onto other things with no direct connection to Windows [Phone] apps?</li>
  <li>What persuaded you to come the first time?</li>
  <li>If you were nervous about attending at any time, why?</li>
  <li>Did anything happen or change to stop you wanting to come back?</li>
  <li>Would future meetings be interesting to you?</li>
  <li>What was the best thing about having attended in the past?</li>
  <li>Which meeting and for what reason (subject, speaker, location, whatever) was your favourite?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>matt.</p>
