Because I don’t want you to feel left out:</p>

<hr />

<p>It feels like I’ve been doing this for years. Part of that is probably because I have.<br />
Those days of meeting in the basement of a pub to talk about developing for Windows Phone 7 are now just a distant memory.<br />
Since those days much has changed. Changes for me, changes for you, changes for the group and changes in the apps we develop and the platforms we develop them for.</p>

<p>I know many of you who will receive this are no longer in a position to attend user group meetings or have other priorities in your lives (and apps). That’s one of the great things about life: it changes and presents new opportunities and experiences.<br />
If that’s you but you think there may be a time when you come to meetings again if the circumstances or the topic was right I’d love to hear from you what would bring you back. Is it a particular topic or speaker? Some specific type of event? Whatever it may be just reply to this email and let me know. I promise to read everything you write.</p>

<p>If you are still able to and interested in attending events then I want to make sure you’re aware of the following:</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday October 28th</strong><br />
It’s our regular meeting at Microsoft’s office in Victoria. We have two speakers arranged. Firstly Tarun Arora will be showing us some of the ALM and DevOps tools in Visual Studio Online. Then Timur from Badoo will share some of the tools and techniques they use to build their apps.<br />
More details and registration via: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/224636443/">http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/224636443/</a></p>

<p><strong>Saturday November 14th</strong><br />
Back in April we held a one day hackathon in partnership with UICentric. It was so popular we’re doing it again. These events are a special type of hackathon where we explicitly focus on completing projects. If you want to come and build something from start to finish in a day that great but we also want to provide a space, opportunity and incentive for those of you who currently have something in progress to get it in a place where you can submit it to the store. That’s why we call this event ‘Submit-It!’.<br />
Details and registration: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/225592021/">http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/225592021/</a></p>

<p><strong>Wednesday November 18th</strong><br />
Apps World Europe is a major conference happening at London’s ExCel center on the 18th and 19th of November. After they heard how great the apps of the people who attend our meetings are they invited us to hold a meeting there at the end of the first day. So we are. You can attend the whole conference, just one day or just our meeting. Do whatever works for you.<br />
You’ll have to register as an Apps World delegate to attend (there are free expo passes available) but more details at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/225200214/">http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/225200214/</a></p>

<p><strong>And finally.</strong><br />
Every few months I ask you to take part in a survey by Vision Mobile to create their Developer Economics report. If you do you not only get a copy of the report but you also have a chance to win some prizes too. Last time one of our regular meeting attendees won an Oculus Rift dev<br />
Participation in the study also helps promote the group and raises our profile and credibility which helps produce great events in the future. So please follow this link to participate: <a href="http://vmob.me/DE1Q16WinAppsLdn">http://vmob.me/DE1Q16WinAppsLdn</a></p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
