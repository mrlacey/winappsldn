    <h2 id="a-code-of-conduct">A code of conduct?</h2>

<p>You may be aware that in the world of conferences and hackathons over the last year or so the subject of having a ‘code of conduct’ has become a hot topic. There are a variety of opinions on the subject and for a long time there has been much debate over whether it was necessary or appropriate for us to have one.</p>

<p>There has been no specific event that has driven this and I’m not aware of any problems in the past. It’s not something to have for the people who are coming. A code of conduct actually exists for the people who aren’t coming but might. We know that we welcome anyone who’s interested in learning about creating apps whoever you are. Unfortunately for some who’ve never been they may not have that belief. We want people who are considering coming to know they’ll be welcomed and safe and for them to have confidence that it won’t be a negative experience.</p>

<p>For this reason we now have a code of conduct.</p>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this please get in touch.</p>

<h1 id="conference-code-of-conduct">Conference Code of Conduct</h1>

<h2 id="the-quick-version">The Quick Version</h2>

<p>We’re dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organisers.</p>

<h2 id="the-less-quick-version">The Less Quick Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors and speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff immediately. Organisers and staff can be found at the entrance to the venue or will have identified themselves at the start of the event.</p>

<p>Organisers and staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide support, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any event. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at event venues and any related social events.</p>
