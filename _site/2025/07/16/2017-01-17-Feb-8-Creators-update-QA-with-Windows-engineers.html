<p>We’re back. And starting 2017 in style!</p>

<p>This meeting coincides with the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/01/11/join-us-feb-8th-windows-developer-day-creators-update-livestream/">Windows Developer Day – Creators Update livestream</a> but there’s more. Not only will we be having a “viewing party” but we’ve also secured access to a Q&amp;A with members of the Windows engineering team straight after. <strong>This will be your opportunity to ask questions about what’s announced to the people who built it</strong>.</p>

<p>This will be your opportunity to see what’s new for developers in the Windows 10 Creators Update. We’ll watch and learn what it means for your apps and games, and more about Microsoft’s latest developer products. Information will cover updates in developing for the web or UWP, the latest consumer apps, and line-of-business tools.</p>

<p>While the live stream will be available online to anyone, the engineering team Q&amp;A is only accessible to those who attend the “viewing party” in person.</p>

<p>In addition to the exclusive Q&amp;A, we’ll provide some food and drink to all attending. Plus, we’ll have some goodies to give away too.</p>
