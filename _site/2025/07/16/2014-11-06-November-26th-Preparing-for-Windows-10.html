<p>At the end of September <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/09/30/announcing-windows-10/">Microsoft announced Windows 10</a>- the next version of Windows.<br />
This has implications for everyone building apps for Windows and Windows Phone (or who’s thinking about it).</p>

<p>We’ll look at what’s been said, what hasn’t, and make some reasonable assumptions about what we can take from this. We’ll start with a presentation but then open into a discussion about what developers and designers can do now. Come share your thoughts, plans and ideas, plus hear what others are thinking.</p>

<p>We’ll also look at the tools we’ll be using to build apps for Windows 10 - Visual Studio 14 and C#6.0.</p>

<p>And of course there will be the usual food, drink and networking.</p>
