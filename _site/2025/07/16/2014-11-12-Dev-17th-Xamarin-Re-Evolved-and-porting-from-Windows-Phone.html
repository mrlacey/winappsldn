<p>In December (17th), we’ll be joined again by <a href="https://twitter.com/SoftSavage">Dominique Louis</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/micjames6">Michael James</a> from Xamarin.</p>

<p>They’ll be recapping the important announcements from the <a href="https://evolve.xamarin.com/">Evolve</a> conference and show us how to make the most of taking an app that is currently on Windows Phone and using Xamarin’s tools reach other platforms too.</p>

<p>As ever there’ll be an opportunity for you to share or demo what you’ve been working on too. Please get in touch if you have something to show.</p>

<p>Plus there will be food, drink and plenty of networking opportunities.</p>

<p>If you’re planning on coming it help us plan if you can please <a href="http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/210456442/" title="Register on MeetUp">register</a>.</p>
