At the London leg of the recent [//publish/](https://publishwindows.com/) event Microsoft had some staff in attendance who held drop in sessions to help with any development related questions. These were so popular they've offered to do a similar thing before our [meeting next week (](http://wpug42.eventbrite.com/)[May 28th)](http://wpug42.eventbrite.com/).

Come along to a trial _Windows App Consult drop in session_ where you can meet with a member of Microsoft’s Global Business Support team.  Bring along your design, coding and troubleshooting topics to get advice and guidance from the guys that deliver support to Microsoft’s developer customers.  This will start from 5PM, before the main meeting, and continue through the evening.

For the sake of clarity this applies to your Windows and Windows Phone apps.

There's no need to book, just turn up from 5pm for some extra assistance, if you need it, and then stay for the meeting afterwards.

As a trial we're interested in your feedback on this. Thanks.
