You may have heard that some Windows Phone Development MVPs around the world are running community led Windows Phone development training days in October. (Originally they were all going to be in the same week but the number of events has grown to fill the whole month.)

See the full list of events at ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;wpcommunityweek.eventday.com/~~

Rather than see the UK left out on all the fun we're hosting the UK Leg of the series in London on October 30th.

Those of you who've attended our meetings in the past should note that this is a different event to what we've done in the past. This is a full day event.  
Usual proceedings will resume in due course.

The day will feature a number of talks from UK MVPs and community leaders. There will be sessions to bring you up to speed if you're new to Windows Phone development and some deep dives into some areas if you've done some development already. Full agenda to be published soon.
