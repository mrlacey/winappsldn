Our friends, [Scott](https://twitter.com/scottisafool) & [Dan](https://twitter.com/dannyt), down in Bournemouth are organising a free, full day of Windows Phone Developer related goodness on August 31st. (They did a similar think last year too.)

A couple of speakers have already been announced and there are more announcements coming soon.

Full details at [http://wpdd.moov2.com/](http://wpdd.moov2.com/) or follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wpddbmth).

See you there.
