**IMPORTANT CHANGE OF VENUE FOR TOMORROW!**

If you're coming you need to know this!

Due to events beyond our control, the venue for tomorrow has changed. We'll now be at  
The Shooting Star cellar bar (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;www.shootingstar-city.co.uk/~~)  
If you came to/remember our meetings in January and February this year, it's that venue.

The address is: The Shooting Star, 125-129 Middlesex St, E1 7JF London

I'm really sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.  
Hopefully you can still make it and we'll see you tomorrow.
