As you're probably aware, we regularly tweet the latest Windows Phone development related news, information and blog posts on [our @wpug twitter account](https://twitter.com/wpug). We do this to help share details and help everyone who is interested to be aware of all that's going on and to enable people be suitably informed to create the best apps they can.

Monitoring all posts on an account can be hard (especially if you don't want to set up mobile notifications) so to help make the links we share on Twitter more accessible we have a searchable archive of all our past tweets at [http://tweets.wpug.net/](http://tweets.wpug.net/).

We recognise that this isn't how everyone wants to receive their news though.

This year we're adding a new way to help people keep track of all that's going on in the world of #WPDev.

**Introducing [WPDev Weekly](http://wpdevweekly.com/). A weekly summary email of all the #WPDev news from the last week.**

If twitter isn't your thing or you just want to make sure you don't miss anything interesting just [head on over to the website and subscribe](http://wpdevweekly.com/).  
Want to see the kind of thing you'll be getting? Take a look at the [archive](http://wpdevweekly.com/archive/) to see what's been sent already.
