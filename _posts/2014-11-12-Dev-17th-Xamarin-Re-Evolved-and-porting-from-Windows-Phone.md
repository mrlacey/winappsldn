In December (17th), we'll be joined again by [Dominique Louis](https://twitter.com/SoftSavage) and [Michael James](https://twitter.com/micjames6) from Xamarin.

They'll be recapping the important announcements from the [Evolve](https://evolve.xamarin.com/) conference and show us how to make the most of taking an app that is currently on Windows Phone and using Xamarin's tools reach other platforms too.

As ever there'll be an opportunity for you to share or demo what you've been working on too. Please get in touch if you have something to show.

Plus there will be food, drink and plenty of networking opportunities.

If you're planning on coming it help us plan if you can please [register](http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/210456442/ "Register on MeetUp").
