Every now and again the question of the name of the group is raised...

There is a historical precedent in groups for developers being called "user groups". This is because originally the only users of computers were developers and the name has just stuck. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Users%27\_group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Users%27_group) for more history.

Additionally we also don't want to just be about developers, but also have a focus on the design and business sides of creating successful applications for the platform. Although heavily developer focused we don't want to have a name which might put off people more interested in related areas other than just the coding/development side of things.
