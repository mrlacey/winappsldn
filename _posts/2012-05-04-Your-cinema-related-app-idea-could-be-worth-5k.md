As prompted by [Mike](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukmsdn/archive/2012/05/04/interested-in-cinema.aspx), the International Union of Cinemas (UNIC) has launched a new competition with 3 finalist going to Barcelona for a chance to compete for an ultimate prize of €5,000.

All you need is an idea (not a prototype or app) but the deadline is May 31.

For more details head to [the UNIC website](http://www.unic-cinemas.org/2012/05/cinema-digital-innovation-award/).
