More than just beer and pizza!  
Our meetings are typically held in the evening. Most people who attend come straight from work and so our meetings are at a time when they would normally be eating their evening meal.  
We don't want you to miss out and we know that you can't buy any food in the rooms where we're meeting at the moment. (Obviously this wasn't the case when we were meeting in pubs and bars.)  
Rather than leave people to get hungry or not come because they'd miss out on eating, we provide, courtesy of Microsoft, food and drink at our meetings.

Catering for large numbers of people isn't straight forward and some of the ways in which everyone is different mean that through choice, belief or medical conditions not everyone can eat everything. Pizza and lager are the food and drink of choice for some but not everyone wants, or can, eat and drink them.

At our meetings we normally order a mix of pizzas with a range of sides. We also provide a wide variety of soft and alcoholic drinks.  
When requested we've previously catered for vegetarians, vegans, coeliacs and more. We try our best to cater to everyone's specific needs but, hopefully obviously, can't always deal with every request. Especially if it is received at the last minute.

If you have any special requirements or requests **please let us know when you register** or email '~~info \[at\] windowsapps \[dot\] london~~'.
