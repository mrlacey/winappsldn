If you're coming to our meeting on Monday then you may want some directions.  
Here are Nokia's instructions:

> Its super easy to get to our building from Paddington Station. Just walk down platform 8 until you get to the end and follow signs to the Hammersmith & City line. Just before the Hammersmith & City tube barriers, there is an exit for Grand Union Canal. Walk up the stairs and you’ll see signs for Kingdom street. Turn left and just follow the signs for Kingdom Street. We are @ Two Kingdom Street past all the shops and eating places but before the Novotel hotel.

If you want to see it on a map then go to [http://binged.it/16ke0H5](http://binged.it/16ke0H5)
