This week Microsoft have been holding an event in London called Tech Days. Held in a cinema in Fulham, there has been content in a number of streams and focusing on a variety of topics for developers and IT professionals. Over the last 2 days there has been lots of information about developing for Windows Phone 7. Of course we were there representing the community, along with many of our regulars.

After the first of these two days we held a party in the bar next to the Tech.Days venue. This was instead of our usual meeting this month and provided an opportunity to meet and chat with other people who are or are interested in developing for the phone. If you came (and helped drink the drink and eat the food) we hope you had a great time.

If this party was your first exposure to our group we'd love to see you at our next "proper" meeting. It's on June 22nd and you can find more details and registration at [http://wpug10.eventbrite.com/](http://wpug10.eventbrite.com/).
