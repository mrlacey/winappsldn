Dev4Good (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;dev4good.net/~~) normally organise charity hack days but in March they're getting the Windows Phone 8 bug.  
On March 16th & 17th, they're organising a 30(ish) hour hackathon to build Windows Phone 8 apps for children and young people.

With sponsorship from Microsoft, Nokia and [Foolproof](http://www.foolproof.co.uk/) there will be food, drink, prizes, a place to put sleeping bags, plus designers and technical support on hand if and when needed.

As with all hackathons, you will get the most from attending if you can stay for the whole event but this isn't a requirement.

The appeal of the event means that there are, apparently, just a few spaces left so head over to [http://windowsphone8appsforkids.eventbrite.com/](http://windowsphone8appsforkids.eventbrite.com/) for more details and to register.
