If you're in (or near) London and are looking to get involved in a developer event in September you should check out the following:

On the 10th & 11th is Over the Air (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;overtheair.org/blog/~~).  
On the 18th & 19th is Charity Hack (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;charityhack.org/~~).

Both will have hackers/developers working on Windows Phone 7 apps and both come highly recommended.
