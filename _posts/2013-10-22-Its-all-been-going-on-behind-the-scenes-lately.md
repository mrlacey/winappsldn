I know for some of you it seems like things have been very quiet since our last meeting. Don't worry, we've been keeping busy though.

On October 30th we're  hosting the final leg (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/8105155739~~) of the global WinPhoneWeek series of events (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;wpcommunityweek.eventday.com/~~). This is a change from our usual events as it's in the daytime and it's for people with very little Windows Phone development experience.  
Please note that this event has been very popular and there is a large wait list. Save yourself disappointment by not turning up if you haven't registered as health and safety requirements mean we are strictly limited on numbers.

In November things will be back to normal though as on the 20th we return to Nokia's London office for a more traditional meeting. Details, as ever, can be found on ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;wpug37.eventbrite.com/~~ and [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/145735322/).
