The [Windows Developer Day](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/09/14/windows-developer-day-returns/) returns on October 10th and it's being broadcast from London.

There isn't room for us to attend the broadcast (I asked several times) but we are able to go one better.

On the next day  (**Wednesday 11th October**) we'll be joined by the members of the Windows engineering team who made the announcements for a special social, Q&A event. You'll be able to ask them your questions about what was announced and anything to do with developing for the Fall (Autumn) Creators Update.

After the last developer day we had a "viewing party" with a Skype Q&A straight after the keynote and there was a lot of feedback that you would have preferred more time to reflect on the announcement before asking questions. Hopefully, 24 hours will be enough. There will also be the opportunity to ask any other questions of the team and it'll be great to meet up as a group again for the first time in a few months.

**If you'd like to come, [please register on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/243674562/)** and we'll look forward to seeing you there.
