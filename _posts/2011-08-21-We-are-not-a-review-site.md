We've started to get a few people asking us to write reviews of their apps.  
That's not what we're here for.

The Windows Phone User Group exists to allow those interested in designing and developing for Windows Phone to learn from and with each other.  
If you want to promote your app via the group then come to a meeting and give us a demo.  
We'll give you 10-15 minutes to tell us about your app:

* What does the app do?
* Why did you build it?
* Were there any problems you had during development? And how did you overcome them?
* What did you learn from the development of the app?
* Whatâ€™s the best thing about the app?
* What do you have planned for future versions?

I'm sure your apps are wonderful and there are lots of websites which would like to write about them but we're not one of them.

That being said, if you are a member of our group (if you've come to a meeting then you qualify) and would be interested in writing some reviews for this site then get in touch.
