Firstly, on Saturday (20th) it's the "Windows Apps JumpStart LIVE Series: Publish Hackathon". More details and registration via [http://aka.ms/winappspublishhack](http://aka.ms/winappspublishhack)

Then, on Wednesday (24th) we'll be hearing about Azure Mobile Services and Application Insights. If you haven't heard of Application Insights before check out this article [http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/developers/articles/week03sep14/improve-your-product-by-analysing-real-world-usage-data](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/developers/articles/week03sep14/improve-your-product-by-analysing-real-world-usage-data)  More details and registration on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/196599562/) - so we know how many are coming and can order food and drink accordingly (There's NO NEED to register on both)

I hope to see you at one or both of the above.
