State of the Developer Nation, the 6th Developer Economics report, features in-depth analysis and insights into the key issues in the app economy, including platform prioritisation, going beyond tablets, trending revenue models, and making the right choices in developer tools. The report is based on the largest developer survey, with over 7,000 respondents.
