This month we're going to be joined by Xamarin's James Montemagno who's visiting from Seattle.

What do you want to know about building apps with Xamarin?  
Please let us know when registering or in the comments and James has agreed to talk about the topics that are most requested.

Garry has also volunteered to talk about his experience in taking the Xamarin certification exam. If that's something you're interested in doing too, he may have some useful tips for you.

And as ever, we'd love to hear about the apps you've been building. If you're interested in demoing your and and sharing a little about your experience of building it please get in touch.

If youâ€™re planning on coming please register on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/219701132/) **OR** ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;wal52.eventbrite.com/~~ so that we have an idea of how many to expect and can organise catering appropriately.

There's no need to register on both :)
