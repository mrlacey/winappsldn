Last weekend we organised the Submit-It! hackathon.  
It was one day of people finishing and then submitting apps to the Windows and Windows Phone stores.

During the day the apps that were submitted (either as updates or new apps) are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Beerweiser** | for Windows Phone  |
| **Bikometer** | for Windows Phone |
| **Castle Hill Crash** | for Windows Phone |
| **Clock24hr-M** | for Windows Phone |
| **Hexpand** | for Windows |
| **Izaak's Favourite Things** | for Windows and Windows Phone |
| **LondonLive** | for Windows Phone  |
| **Match The Pairs** | for Windows Phone  |
| **Milestone Planner** | for Windows |
| **Music Central Preview** | for Windows Phone |

If you want to find out more, Jay has written a blog post about the day (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;www.jayonwindows.com/submit-it-a-hackathon-co-hosted-by-ui-centric-and-windows-apps-london/~~) and there are lots of pictures on [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/photos/26068204/).

As the day proved so popular we'll probably do something similar again.
