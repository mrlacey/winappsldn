Our next meeting is on May 28th and will again be at

We'll be hearing about the [Application Developers Alliance](http://appdevelopersalliance.org/) and we'll also be joined by Andy Wigley (from Microsoft) who will be recapping the highlights of the recent [Windows Phone 8.1 Jumpstart](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Building-Apps-for-Windows-Phone-8-1) and telling us all we need to know about **universal apps**.

If you can make it, it'll be great to see you there.

If you're planning to come it helps us plan catering if you can let us know. Please register via ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;wpug42.eventbrite.com/~~ OR meetup to let us know your intention.
