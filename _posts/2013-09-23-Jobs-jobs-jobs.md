Jobs, we all need them and it's almost always preferable to have one doing something you enjoy.  
Many of you work with Windows Phone full time and we know that a lot of you would like to.  
We're also aware that more and more companies are looking to recruit people to work on Windows Phone related projects and we're increasingly contacted by them to help find people.

Previously we've done this on an ad hoc basis but as demand is increasing we've opted for a more structured approach.
