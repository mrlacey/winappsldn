![XNA-UK](/winappsldn/images/xna-uk.jpg "XNA-UK") + ![WPUG](/winappsldn/images/phone.png "WPUG")

Come join both the XNA-UK (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;xna-uk.net/~~) and Windows Phone User groups for a mad bash twitter evening in a DevChat style Mashup on:

## Thursday 21st July  
7 – 9 PM UK time  
#DevChatUK

We’re going to hijack the twitter hashtag #DevChatUK and do a wide scale Q&A / Chat session on all things Phone, XNA, Silverlight and Mobile development in general (including multi-platform questions)

So come join in, publicise your current projects, lets us know who you are or just come and get info on what all this noise is about with online help from the experts in the field.

We recommend using a web service like ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;tweetchat.com/~~ and enter the HashTag #DevChatUK to join in the fun.
