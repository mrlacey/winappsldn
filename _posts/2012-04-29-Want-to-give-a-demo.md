A major part of our meetings are the demos given by people who have released apps.

If you want to demo at a future meeting (or the upcoming [WPBarCamp](http://wpug.net/wpbarcamp/)) then you might want to know what to consider when giving a demo.

When people give app demos we ask them to answer the following questions:

* What does the app do?
* Why did you build it?
* Were there any problems you had during development? And how did you overcome those issues?
* What did you learn from the development of the app?
* What’s the best thing about the app?
* What do you have planned for future versions?

That's it. Very simple.  
And because  it's a subject you know well (your app) you'll find it really easy.  
So no excuse for not giving it a go then ;)

If you want to bring your own laptop that's great. We recommend ensuring that everything runs fine at 1024x768 to ensure it works with any projector and if you're showing code, be sure to set the font size in Visual Studio to at least 14pt before you start.

If you want to borrow a laptop for your demo then that's fine too. Just bring a copy of your XAP, PPT or whatever on a USB drive.

We strongly recommend having a backup of your files available (privately if necessary) on-line too. Yes, we've had people turn up in the past, only to discover that their laptop had died or the USB drive wasn't working.
