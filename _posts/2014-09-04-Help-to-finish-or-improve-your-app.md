At the May and June events, engineers from Microsoft’s Windows App Consult team attended.  These engineers work in Microsoft’s Global Business Support organisation providing assistance to Microsoft’s developer customers across the UK and Europe. The Windows App Consult team help developers ensure they have a quality application and can help with development issues, debugging, troubleshooting and reviewing apps. They can also highlight design issues and generally provide tips on how to improve applications.

Most of you said having a service like this would be useful so I’m working with Microsoft on the best way to secure us some resource and ensure the time is best utilised. Although useful to have an engineer at the event, we could probably make better use of time and provide more value to you by considering booking engineers for Remote App Consultation. This would mean that instead to getting 20-30 mins to discuss your application at the event, you can request a Remote App Consultation, which would give you individual time with an Engineer for up to 3 hours.  This time could be used more flexibly over phone and email to provide you with assistance.  Please note that depending on availability and the nature of your request it may take a few days to line somebody up to help you.

If you've got an app that’s almost finished or you need helping improving an app you've already released you can request a review by filling in the form at [https://www.microsofttechupdate.co.uk/remote-app-consult-request/](https://www.microsofttechupdate.co.uk/remote-app-consult-request/)
