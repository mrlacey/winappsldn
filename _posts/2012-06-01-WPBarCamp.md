May 2012 saw us present the first WP Bar Camp. Like our evening meetings it was an opportunity for experienced Windows Phone developers to meet and learn from and with each other.

It was the best parts of our usual meetings combined with a bar camp. Plus, it was on a Saturday so those who can't normally get to our evening meetings could come.

**What happened:**

We had 9 sessions covering topics including the forthcoming release from Telerik, development tips, lessons learnt from the apps people had shipped, promotional tips and advice on turning a hobby (developing apps) into a job.
