Our [next meeting](http://wpug31.eventbrite.com/) is on May 20th and is being hosted by our friends at Nokia.

As part of the meeting we'll be hosting a demo showcase. This is an opportunity to show off an app you've built.

**Why might you want to participate?**

The most popular app, as voted on the night, will be **rewarded with promotion in the store**.

What's so great about that?  
Just ask anyone who has had an app featured in the store. The exposure of an app in the store leads to more downloads.

You want more people downloading your app don't you?!

But there's more.  
We normally have writers from some of the largest Windows Phone related sites in attendance. This could be a great opportunity to get your app in front of people keen to hear about exciting new apps that they can write about. Those articles also typically translate into a big spike in downloads too.

Why wouldn't you want to take part and potentially get more exposure of and downloads for your app?

There's just two criteria:

1. Your app must not have been demoed at WPUG before
2. Your app must include Window Phone 8 specific functionality

Typically we ask people to share a little about the lessons they learnt in the creation of the app they're demoing. For this event we're suspending that rule though. If you just want to show off your app that's fine.

If you want to demo (one of) your app(s) then you need to register, either via [eventbrite](http://wpug31.eventbrite.com/) or [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/117227082/) (there's no need to register on both) and then drop me a line to say that you want to participate.

Of course if you want to come along and see what app others have created then please do. Just register so we know how many to expect. Thanks.
