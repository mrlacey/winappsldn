Last night was the 11th meeting of the Windows Phone User Group and it was another successful event.

[![Matt gives the intro](http://wpug.net/images/328049364.jpg)](http://twitpic.com/5fb8ic)

About 40 of us filled the basement of our regular venue ([Juno bar in Shoreditch](http://www.junoshoreditch.co.uk/)) to talk [#WP7Dev](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23wp7dev).

This month we heard from a number of people demoing apps they had made plus sharing some of the lessons learnt in their creation and their plans for new updates and features using the Mango tools.

First up was [Mark Rendle](http://twitter.com/#!/markrendle) who showed [Pocket C#](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=2f840483-0a54-e011-854c-00237de2db9e). This was one of the [winners of RedGate's WP7Comp](http://wp7comp.posterous.com/red-gate-softwares-windows-phone-7-competitio).

Secondly [Paul Marsh](http://twitter.com/#!/pauliom) showed us [Steam Achievements](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=75d6f30c-0f8b-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8).

> "@pauliom great talk at @wpug and really useful app for steam addicts. The website is really great as well to showcase the app" -[Mendzapp](http://twitter.com/#!/Mendzapp/status/83691658000080896)

Next up was [KeyboardP](http://twitter.com/#!/keyboardP) who showed us 2 simple apps he'd released (including [Songs Alike](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=3b313436-2495-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8)) as part of an experiment into application optimization. He also shared some very interesting tips on application pricing.

After a short break, [Paul](http://twitter.com/#!/pauliharman) and Ben from [LedaEntertainment](http://twitter.com/#!/ledaentertain) demoed [InterSceptre](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=92714050-f17a-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) and [AstroSwag](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=4bbc8376-9886-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8)

> "Awesome evening at the @WPUG meetup, met some great people and heard some very interesting info! Thanks all!" - [roybott](http://twitter.com/#!/Roybott/status/83673530495016962)

Andrew Fraser shared some of his experiences around translating/localizing apps as well as text to speech and speech to text conversions that were part of several projects including [Free Wikipedia Viewer](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=3a50d92c-3205-e011-9264-00237de2db9e). He also pointed us to [http://wp7resxlocgenerator.codeplex.com/](http://wp7resxlocgenerator.codeplex.com/)

To finish the evening [James Mundy](http://twitter.com/#!/Mendzapp) gave us a demo of [Travelnapp](http://ow.ly/5esOv)

The evening didn't end there though. Many of us stayed to chat and share development tips, tricks and experiences late into the night.

Unfortunately we had a bit of noise coming down from the band playing upstairs but the presenters all coped marvellously. We will be doing everything we can to prevent this affecting us at future events.

> "Had a good time with @Andy\_Gore, @ngmagill, @lookitskris, @keyboardP (very briefly), @kudresov and the @verysoftware guys at tonight's @wpug" - [GergelyOrosz](http://twitter.com/#!/GergelyOrosz/status/83659043012489216)

Videos of each of the demos will, hopefully, be available soon. Meanwhile, why not download the apps and try them for yourself.

> "Just got back from @wpug. Had a great time as always. Nice meeting everyone!" - [keyboardp](http://twitter.com/#!/keyboardP/status/83671372215226368)

Details of July's event will be announced shortly...
