"The configuration unit could not be found."

As an error message, that isn't very helpful.

What's a "configuration unit"?

Was there an id or value that couldn't be found?

Where did you look?

Are there other places that could be configured to search in?

Was the format ok?

Did the service return a "Not found" error state, or is this a generic message for "something went wrong?


Whatever the case here, it should be a reminder to us that any error or exception message we output not only indicates that something went wrong but also help the person the message is being shown to to solve the problem.
