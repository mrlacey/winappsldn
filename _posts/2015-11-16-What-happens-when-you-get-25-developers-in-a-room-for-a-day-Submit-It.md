A. They submit 25 apps to the store.

Well that's [what we did on the Saturday just gone](http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/225592021/). There were a mixture of new apps, apps updated to support Windows 10 (mobile and desktop as a single UWP) and other updates to existing Windows8.1 and Windows Phone apps.  
These are (most of--some are stuck in certification) the apps in question.
