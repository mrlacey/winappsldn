That's right, we're having 2 meetings this July.

The first, with [Gill Cleeren at Telerik](http://wpug.net/2013/06/25/a-special-meeting-at-telerik-in-july/), is already fully booked, and we expect the second to be equally popular.

On **July 23rd** we'll be joining the lovely folks at [UI Centric](http://www.uicentric.com/), who will be talking about their design processes and how they've applied them to Windows Phone.

We'll also be hearing from Glynn Jones, CEO of [Scoopt](http://scoopt.com/). He'll be talking about the lessons learnt when they ported their app to Windows Phone but also what they've learnt in forming a start up around an app.

If you wish to come, please register at [http://wpug34.eventbrite.com/](http://wpug34.eventbrite.com/) OR [http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/126544572/](http://www.meetup.com/wpuguk/events/126544572/)  
There is no need to register at both. Just one will do. We provide the option of registering with either as we know some people have strong preferences/opinions about the two sites.

Again spaces are limited so if you register but later find you are unable to attend please let us know so we can offer the space to someone else.
