If you were holding off from registering for [our meeting this month](http://notatmwc12.eventbrite.com/) until you knew who would be speaking then wait no longer.

As announced on [his blog](http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2012/02/wpug-talk-developing-cross-platform-mobile-applications-with-phonegap-for-windows-phone-7/), **Colin Eberhardt** ([@ColinEberhardt](https://twitter.com/ColinEberhardt)) will be travelling down from Edinburgh to talk about PhoneGap (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;phonegap.com/~~). (See a full synopsis of what he's planning to talk about [on his blog](http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2012/02/wpug-talk-developing-cross-platform-mobile-applications-with-phonegap-for-windows-phone-7/).

Also speaking will be Tristan ([@codeglee](https://twitter.com/codeglee)) and Neil ([@DukeOfMuppets](https://twitter.com/DukeOfMuppets)) from [Compsoft](http://www.compsoft.co.uk/). (You may recognize them from the [Redshift alphalabs.cc project](http://alphalabs.cc/project/70-redshift).)  
They spend their days developing for a variety of mobile platforms and will be talking about their experiences and sharing some tips on what Windows Phone developers can learn from other platforms.

Unfortunately our other speaker, who was going to talk about what it's like to transition from being an iOS developer to a Windows Phone one has had to postpone his talk until a future date.  
This means that we have an opening if anyone else would like to share their experiences of developing for more than just Windows Phone.

And we'll also be having a quick recap of any relevant announcements from MWC so far. Plus the usual drinking and socialising.

Just in case you need the reminder. We'll be at **the Shooting Star** again and it's on a **TUESDAY**.
