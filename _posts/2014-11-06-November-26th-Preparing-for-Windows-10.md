title: November 26th: Preparing for Windows 10

At the end of September [Microsoft announced Windows 10](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/09/30/announcing-windows-10/)\- the next version of Windows.  
This has implications for everyone building apps for Windows and Windows Phone (or who's thinking about it).

We'll look at what's been said, what hasn't, and make some reasonable assumptions about what we can take from this. We'll start with a presentation but then open into a discussion about what developers and designers can do now. Come share your thoughts, plans and ideas, plus hear what others are thinking.

We'll also look at the tools we'll be using to build apps for Windows 10 - Visual Studio 14 and C#6.0.

And of course there will be the usual food, drink and networking.
