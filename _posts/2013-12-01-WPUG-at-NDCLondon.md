This coming week (2-6 Dec) sees [NDC come to London](http://www.ndc-london.com/). Over the week there are a [wide range of sessions](http://ndclondon.oktaset.com/Agenda/wednesday) and [tickets are still available](http://www.ndc-london.com/tickets_for_ndc_london).

[We](http://wpug.net/) will be there on all the session days and you'll find us in the community area. Come by and talk all things Windows Phone. :)

In the community area you'll find a range of groups covering a breadth of subjects and interests. They'll be organising and hosting a number of events between the main sessions, including quizzes and short talks.

**At 10AM on Thursday we'll be hosting a Windows Phone quiz.**

**First prize is a Windows Store gift card worth Â£50** which can be used to purchase apps, games and more for both Windows Phone and Windows 8. We'll have smaller, runners up prizes too.

Additionally, [Matt](https://twitter.com/mrlacey) is offering to provide [consultation to help improve your apps](http://wpug.net/2013/11/27/leave-ndc-london-with-a-better-app/). Get in touch with him in advance if this interests you.
