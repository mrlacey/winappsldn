Yes, we're back for 2012 and we even have a [new venue](http://www.pubandbar-network.co.uk/pubs/venue_london_liverpool%20st_shooting%20star_356.html)!  
We're excited to be joined this month by [Alan Mendelvich](https://twitter.com/ailon) from [AdDuplex](http://www.adduplex.com/) who'll be providing his **Developer's Guide to Windows Phone App Marketing and Monetization** plus we'll have our usual combination of demos and socialising.  
More details are on [http://wpug18.eventbrite.com/](http://wpug18.eventbrite.com/).  
See you there.
