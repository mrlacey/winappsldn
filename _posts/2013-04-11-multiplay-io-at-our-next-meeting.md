On the 23rd we'll be joined by Ashraf from multiplay.io.

!["multiplay-wp8"](https://mrlacey.github.io/winappsldn/images/multiplay-wp8.png)

To give us an idea of what we'll be talking about and what we can expect form his talk we've asked him to tell us a bit about it.

> We’ve been working between the intersection of HTML5 and native technologies developing a cross­platform 3D multiplayer games.
> 
> In this talk, we would like to go over the process of porting and publishing a multiplayer 3d iOS/Android game to support Windows Phone 8 and Direct3D. Explaining a lot of the teething issues we've had to deal with, including the wrapping OpenGL to support Direct3D, working between JavaScript, C# and C++ and the server interactions for multiplayer gaming support.
> 
> We will also invite you to participate in a live demo showing the of the creation of new 3d multiplayer games with our realtime games editor.

The talk will be aimed at beginners with the platform and no prior knowledge is assumed.
