If you're interested in taking part in the [MSDN UK competition to build a Windows Phone 7 application](http://blog.mrlacey.co.uk/2011/02/wp7dev-dddhack-competition.html) but were caught out by the original starting code being built against the CTP version of the tools, there is now an alternative version of the code available at ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;wp7rssreader.codeplex.com/~~.

If you were one of the people who told me the original code was "broken" please try this instead. ;)
