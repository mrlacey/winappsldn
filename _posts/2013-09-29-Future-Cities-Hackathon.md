UK Windows Azure User Group are running another hackathon called "Future Cities" on the 5th and 6th October in London. This event will be attended by Microsoft, Microsoft Research, Westminster City Council, Future Cities Catapult (part of the Technology Strategy Board). There will be talks by Microsoft and Microsoft Research and an afternoon session on the Internet of Things and Future Cities by the Technology Strategy Board.  
There are a number of challenges and **thousands of pounds of prizes** on offer. There will be application and web developers as well as data scientists forming teams.

This is a good chance for everyone to augment their skills and learn new ones. There are no restrictions so you can use any languages or tools you want C#, F#, Python, Azure, etc. Meals are served throughout the weekend and coffee and water is on tap!
