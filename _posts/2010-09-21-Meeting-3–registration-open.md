Slightly later than planned, we're back!  
The format will be the same as our previous meetings and will contain a combination of talks and demos combined with a generous helping of Q&A.

We're meeting on October 6th at Imperial College London. We’ll have presentations from Cortexica, who will be showing how to do image recognition from your app, and Red Badger who will be showing XPF, their XNA layout framework.

At WPUG we also love seeing the applications that people are developing. If you're coming and would like to give a short (5 minute) demonstration of an application you've developed please get in touch. Applications can be developed by individuals or organisations and everyone giving a demo will be in with a chance to win a special (but currently secret) prize courtesy of Microsoft.
