Our next few meetings will be at Microsoft's new Modern Jago (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;modernjago.co.uk/~~) space in Shoreditch.

You'll find a map at ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;modernjago.co.uk/find/~~ but unfortunately it's not the easiest place in the world to find. _(Sorry those of you who had difficulty previously.)_

If you need them, here are some directions:

How to get to Modern Jago?

Unfortunately there aren’t any neon signs (good for residents, intriguing for guests), but it’s not too hard to find. Look for the green double doors on Club Row, very close to Arnold Circus. The intercom is clearly marked “Jago”. Just press the button and say “hello”.  
**By Taxi** – Ask for the junction of Club Row and Arnold Circus.  
**By Tube** – The nearest tube stations are Liverpool Street and Old Street, with Shoreditch High Street Overground station very nearby.  
**From Liverpool Street** – head north up Bishopsgate, then east along Bethnal Green Road for two hundred yards, turning left on Club Row.  
**From Old Street** – head east along Old Street until you come across to Shorditch High Street. Turn right on to Shoreditch High Street and then first left on to Calvert Avenue. Carry on until you reach Arnold Circus. Circle around until you find Club Row.  
**From London Waterloo (25mins)** – Take Jubilee Line to Canada Water. Then change for the East London line to Shoreditch High Street. Cross Bethnal Green Road, turning left on Club Row.  
**From Paddington (30mins)** – Take the Hammersmith & City Line to Kings Cross. Change at Kings Cross for the Northern Line, leave the train at Old Street. Directions from Old Street as above.
