To tie in with last weekend's [DDD9](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/ddd9/) event, [MSDNUK](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukmsdn/) are holding a Windows Phone 7 development competition.

There is a phone as a prize for the "best" XNA game and the "best" Silverlight application. The deadline for entries is Feb 12th so get cracking if you want to enter.
