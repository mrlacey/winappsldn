We're sponsoring an event a the Rough Trade East store on Sept 7th.  
Not only will there be live music and free t-shirt printing courtesy of our friends at [Hit+Run](http://thehitandrun.com/) but we've doing this because we've arranged an opportunity to meet the artists performing to discuss the chance to collaborate on app development. Maybe you've got ideas on how to use their music or artwork in an app or would just be in interesting in exploring how you may be able to collaborate. Come and show them what you've made and pitch your ideas.

The artists performing are:  
• **Teebs** – a producer and artist from Los Angeles, signed to the Brainfeeder label run by Flying Lotus. Check out his facebook page at [http://www.facebook.com/teebsio](http://www.facebook.com/teebsio)  
• **Jeremiah Jae** - an experimental Producer, Rapper, Visual Artist, and Multi-instrumentalist based out of Chicago, as well as a recording artist on Brainfeeder/ Warp Records. [http://jeremiahjae.tumblr.com/](http://jeremiahjae.tumblr.com/)  
• **Kutmah** – a talented artist and DJ who recently held an exhibition titled “Two Soups & A Honeybun”, the full collection of 39 drawings Kutmah created in prison. [http://www.brandyflower.com/kutmah/index.html](http://www.brandyflower.com/kutmah/index.html)
