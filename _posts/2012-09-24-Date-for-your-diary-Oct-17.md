After a bit of a summer break, while we were patiently waiting for Windows Phone 8, we now have a date for our next meeting.  
It'll be on **October 17th**. More details to follow...

In the mean time, Nokia are looking to get to know UK Windows Phone developers.

> All you need to do is send your details (~~mailto&#58;&#47;&#47;nick [AT] catchyagency [dot] com~~): name, address, telephone number, email address and perhaps some information on their WP dev experience.  
> You will in turn, in a non-spammy way, receive information on WP development from Nokia, information on events, special details on WP projects etc.

Don't worry though, even if you don't give them your details. We'll be sure, as ever, to pass on details of anything we hear about.
