As part of their sponsorship they're now offering 4 Lumia 1020 devices as part of the prize pool (which also include books, conference passes and cold, hard cash).

Mobile is now a big part of the event. So if you want to show off your phone skills and combine them with some interesting datasets to win fabulous prizes then head on over toÂ [http://futurecitieshackathon.com/](http://futurecitieshackathon.com/)
