If you're a follower of the [@wpug](http://twitter.com/wpug) twitter feed you'll have noticed that it's been a bit quiet over the last month or so.  
There are various reasons for this that I won't bother you with. (I'm fine by the way-thanks for asking.)

This means that there's been loads of news, articles, blogs, etc. which I haven't been tweeting about. As I've just caught up on my reading lists this leaves the question about how to share the relevant articles? I considered drip feeding\* them into the twitter feed.  
This would mean that they potentially get to the regular audience and appear in the [archive](http://tweets.wpug.net/) which can be a useful resource when searching (hint).

The other alternative is just to publish them here. This is what I'm doing.

\* Not drip feeding them and just tweeting them all in a hurry would be likely to upset followers whose time-lines I end up filling.

If you think I should also drip feed them through the twitter account too let me know.

So, **in no particular order**:
