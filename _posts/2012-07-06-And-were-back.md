After a short break, we're back.

Our next meeting will be on Wednesday **July 18th** at the **Vibe Bar**. We'll be following up on last months announcements about **Windows Phone 8** and looking at what this means for those of us who are designing and developing apps.  
Register at ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;wpug23.eventbrite.com/~~

We know this is short notice and the feedback from our recent survey (more on this soon) was that it would be good to have more notice of meetings.  
So, the next meeting after that will be on **August 15th**. Again we'll be at the Vibe bar and looking more at what's possible in Windows Phone 8. Be super organised and register (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;wpug24.eventbrite.com/~~).
