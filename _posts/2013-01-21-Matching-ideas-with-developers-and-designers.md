Do you want to design or develop an app but don't know what?  
Here's an opportunity for you:

Modern Jago are hosting a series of events for those who have ideas and want help turning them into apps. Called "**Ideas to Apps**" there are two parts to the series. The first helps provide guidance those with ideas to help them develop the idea. The second part of the series is called "**Match Making**" and it could be where you come in. On **Jan 26th** and **Feb 11th** match making events will be held and they could be the opportunity you need to find someone with a great idea that you could implement.

> In a speed - matching format, developers will meet designers and designers will meet developers to find the perfect team to turn an idea into an app.
