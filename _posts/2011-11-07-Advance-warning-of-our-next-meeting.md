Despite previous suggestions about a possible meeting in November. Our next meeting will be on December 7th.  
The usual invites will go out once we've confirmed the speakers but if you wish you can register now via [http://wpug17.eventbrite.com/](http://wpug17.eventbrite.com/).  
That's right, we aren't having a meeting in November. This is down to a number of factors: the October meeting was later in the month than usual; other events happening around the same time; and we thought it better to space out our meetings better, rather than have nothing in December.

It's intended that this will be our last meeting at Juno and next year we'll be somewhere bigger. If you're one of the people who said you knew somewhere that may be suitable but never actually told us where, it'd be great if you could get in touch. ;)

See you on the 7th.
