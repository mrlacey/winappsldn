This December, NDC comes to London as the "New Developers Conference".  
Taking place from the 2nd to the 6th it offers 2 days of workshops and 3 days of talks, all at the ExCel arena.

Early bird pricing is available until Sept 16th but because the people who come to WPUG are so awesome, **we'll be giving away a 3-day pass to one attendee of our next meeting**.  
Yes, everyone who attends our next (London) meeting will be entered into a draw for the ticket.

Register for the meeting at ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;eventbrite.com/~~.
