Last week was the 27th meeting of our Windows Phone User Group. It was a special meeting where 6 of our members shared their experiences of porting apps from Windows Phone to Windows 8.

If you couldn't be there yourself or just want to relive the experience you can watch these videos of: [Dave Hamilton](https://vimeo.com/55057230), [Simon Ransom](https://vimeo.com/55057239), [Jim Chapman](https://vimeo.com/55057238), [Gergely Orosz](https://vimeo.com/55059561), [Stuart Lodge](https://vimeo.com/55059562) &Â [Hermit Dave](https://vimeo.com/55057236).

Enjoy
