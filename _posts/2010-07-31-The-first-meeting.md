Wednesday (July 28th) saw our inaurgral meeting, which was kindly hosted by [EMC Consulting](http://uk.emc.com/services/emc-consulting.htm).

On arrival, everyone was greeted with a beer or soft drink (again courtesy of EMC) and donuts:

![mmm donuts!](https://mrlacey.github.io/winappsldn/images/DSC02555.JPG "mmm donuts!")  
And here's a disappointingly blurry picture of a room full of people  
![Full house](https://mrlacey.github.io/winappsldn/images/DSC02557.JPG "Full house")

We started the evening with a presentation by [Rob Fonseca-Ensor](http://twitter.com/robfe) on XNA development in WP7.

A copy of the code from his demo [is also available](https://mrlacey.github.io/winappsldn/assets/Game1.cs).

Between the longer presentations 5 people got up to give 5 minute demonstrations of applicaitons that they are developing.

First was [Dave Hawes](http://twitter.com/davehawes) who showed a client to his Skillbook (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;www.skillbook.co.uk/~~) product:  
  
Second was [Hosain](http://twitter.com/hosainnet) who demonstrated his London Tube application:  
  
Third was Apurva (who also goes by the name [keyboardp](http://twitter.com/keyboardp)) with the ICE Alert app:  
  
Fourthly was [Tristan](http://twitter.com/treeuk) & [Neil](http://twitter.com/DukeOfMuppets) who showed their [CryoDefense](http://www.cryodefense.com/) game:  
  
Finally, [Mike Hole](http://twitter.com/mikehole) & [Howard Scott](http://twitter.com/howard_scott) of [Sequence](http://twitter.com/Sequence_Agency) demonstrated an application they are developing for [Snow and Rock](http://www.snowandrock.com/). Unfortunately we have no video of this.

To help encourage people to demonstrate their applications Micorsoft provided an Xbox to award as aprize to the application deemed the best. The audience voted for the ICE application by Apruva as the most deserving of the Xbox.  
In addition to the Xbox prize, everyone who demonstrates an application in meetings up until the end of the year will go in to a draw to win a "special" prize.

To finish the formal part of the evening, [Paul Foster](http://twitter.com/paulfo) gave an overview of the Marketplace (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;marketplace.windowsphone.com/~~) and held an open Q & A session.

After Paul's presentation we continued the discussions at a nearby pub and we are very grateful to [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en/gb/default.aspx) who kindly being picked up the bar tab.

The hope and intention is that future meetings will have the same format. We're going to try and look at alternative, larger, venues though as with very little promotion we had many more people wish to come than the room could accomodate and we want as many of those who wish to to to be able to attend.
