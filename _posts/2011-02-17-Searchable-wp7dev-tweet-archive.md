I hope you're already aware, but if you're not, we try and post links to useful and relevant Windows Phone 7 development content on our twitter account: ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;twitter.com/wpug~~

We were recently asked:

> ["is there any mech for storing all these links as you send them? Itâ€™s a shame to think they get lost in the twitterverse."](http://twitter.com/mikehole/status/33537833201303552)

While there are [other solutions](http://wp7dev.reddit.com/), we now also have our own. Go to ~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;tweets.wpug.net/~~ and there is a searchable archive of our tweets.

What's the value of this? Well we hope it will provide a useful resource when you're trying to find specific information. Say you want to find something about a **toolkit** (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;tweets.wpug.net/search.php?q=toolkit~~) or **panorama** (~~http&#58;&#47;&#47;tweets.wpug.net/search.php?q=panorama~~) then you can just search for it.
