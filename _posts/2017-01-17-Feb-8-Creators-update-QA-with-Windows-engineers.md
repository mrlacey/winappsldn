We're back. And starting 2017 in style!

This meeting coincides with the [Windows Developer Day â€“ Creators Update livestream](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/01/11/join-us-feb-8th-windows-developer-day-creators-update-livestream/) but there's more. Not only will we be having a "viewing party" but we've also secured access to a Q&A with members of the Windows engineering team straight after. **This will be your opportunity to ask questions about what's announced to the people who built it**.

This will be your opportunity to see whatâ€™s new for developers in the Windows 10 Creators Update. We'll watch and learn what it means for your apps and games, and more about Microsoftâ€™s latest developer products. Information will cover updates in developing for the web or UWP, the latest consumer apps, and line-of-business tools.

While the live stream will be available online to anyone, the engineering team Q&A is only accessible to those who attend the "viewing party" in person.

In addition to the exclusive Q&A, we'll provide some food and drink to all attending. Plus, we'll have some goodies to give away too.
