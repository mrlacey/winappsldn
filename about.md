Windows Apps London exists to help UK based developers to learn from and with each other so we can all create great apps for Windows 8, Windows Phone & other platforms .

We hold monthly meetings in London where there are talks, demos and discussions. Plus there’s usually swag, pizza and drink too.

We were previously known as WPUG (Windows Phone User Group) as we originally focused just on Windows Phone but have now broadened our subject areas to reflect the interest of those attending.

Whether you’re new to app development or have been doing it for years you’re welcome to come and join us at a meeting.

We’re an independent group and do not charge for membership or meeting attendance. We simply ask that you come willing to participate in discussion or share your knowledge and that you register if you’re planning on coming to a meeting.

~If you have any questions about the group please email info [at] windowsapps[dot] london or tweet us via @winappsldn.~
